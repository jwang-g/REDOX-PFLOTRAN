# These are steps to get python-alquimia-PFLOTRAN running on Macbook
## prerequist: Homebrew, Xcode (google to install or install from AppleApp)
## Receipts to install petsc on macbook need to be updated 

# Install PFLOTRAN and build chemical reactions library
# This is a fork of PFLOTRAN with some additional reactions and infrastructure for coupling with ELM
git clone https://github.com/bsulman/pflotran-elm-interface.git
pushd pflotran-elm-interface/src/pflotran
git checkout pflotran-elm-interface
export PETSC_DIR='local petsc install directory'  #e.g., '/Users/yourname/petsc'
export PETSC_ARCH='local petsc arch install directory' ##e.g., 'arch-darwin-c-opt'
export OPENMPI_DIR='which openmpi directory'      # may need to homebrew openmpi for alquimia and pflotran compiling
make pflotran pflotran_rxn
popd
export PFLOTRAN_DIR=$PWD/pflotran-elm-interface

# Install required python packages
#following the link to install anaconda on Mac

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

# This configures your shell so it works better with conda. Only need to run once
conda init
# May need to log out and log in again

# This makes a local copy of the python installations that you can update (only need to run once)
conda create --name myanaconda3 --clone base
conda activate myanaconda3
conda install -c conda-forge pygraphviz ## this will allow to install pygraphviz 
conda install xarray netCDF4 cftime
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py ##this will allow to install mpi4py; 
##if MacOs with apple chip M2 Ultra, petsc may require openmpi, in that case, use conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi
#pip install mpi4py
pip install nc-time-axis

# Install python scripts for running alquimia-based biogeochemical simulations
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bsulman/REDOX-PFLOTRAN.git

# Build alquimia interface
cd REDOX-PFLOTRAN/alquimia
mkdir build
cd build

## make sure cmake is installed on Mac, if not, should install homebrew first to use brew
brew install cmake

#zsh cannot recognize splitter \ in the cmake command.

# This script builds the code needed for connecting python scripts with alquimia
python make_alquimia_python_interface.py   ##make sure the script has the right directory for Macbook (e.g., PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH, and may need to comment out PETSC_PATH because macbook does not really need it)

# Try running a script:
python tidal.py            ## makesure tidal.py has the right directory for pflotran.exe file (e.g.,$PFLOTRAN_DIR/src/pflotran)
